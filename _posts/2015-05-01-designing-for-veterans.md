### Be quiet, respectful and empathic.

These are the principles of Veterans.gov. Unlike many design projects where it's easy to insert style and flourish to your heart's desire, it was clear very early on that designing veterans.gov had to very different. Everything had to be as efficient, succinct and without ornamentation and at the same time, not feel impersonal — wall between a veteran and the service they deserve. Most of all, veterans.gov can't another hurdle to overcome.

Veterans.gov is a small (for now), simple website aimed at meeting the needs of the most frequently interactions a veteran has with the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is by no means complete, exhaustive or definitive. But it is a start in a new direction — a very public experiment in how the agency can communicate going forward.

We're building this with a small team. A few great content strategists / problem solvers, a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and a designer (me, also a former Presidential Innovation fellow). Here's a look at how we're meeting these principles from a design perspective.

### Be quiet

The design is very simple. There are no images, and taking a page from gov.uk, there aren't even any icons to distract you. Text, color, shape, grids help provide structure and hierarchy. In most cases, content is presented in one column. There's less change of getting lost, distracted, or confused about what's truly important. Simply read top to bottom, then make your next decision.

### Be respectful

There are no tricks, nothing to pull your attention from the content that is most important. No sidebar, no widgets. No pop-ups or surveys. Nothing to take your attention away. Content is presented with clear simple, contemporary type designed for the screen.

### Be empathic

We also understand that this content will be used and reused in many different contexts. Building with web standards helps us plan for the unexpected. We're building simple web pages that can easily be printed, displayed in an RSS reader, a Twitter Card, a TV screen, or a news aggregator with the best of results.

### Build something empowering and easy to use.

Veterans.gov is built with the open source Foundation framework. It's mobile first, designed to work well on screen sizes large and small, and internet connections from fast to dial-up. While we can't support every possible browser or technology platform (we're looking at you Internet Explorer 6), we can build on top of a framework that is flexible and serves as many as possible.

Usability testing has been baked into our design process, and will continue to be with every iteration. Nothing tops testing veterans.gov with actual veterans.


### We need your help.

As a designer leading the charge on this project, it's been an amazing privilege to work on such a big challenge filled with great purpose. But we can't do it alone, nor should we.

If you're a designer, copywriter, UX or usability expert, we need your help to make this better. Join us on GitHub and help us provide a level of service to  veterans that we can all be proud of. Got a content edit for us? Found a design problem that needs fixing? We need to hear from you.
