### Be quiet, respectful and empathic.

These are the principles of Veterans.gov. Unlike many design projects where it is so easy - required even - to insert design flourish to your heart's desire, it was clear very early on that veterans.gov had to very different. This project had to be efficient, succinct and at the same time, not feel impersonal — wall between a veteran and the service they deserve. Most of all, veterans.gov can't another hurdle to overcome.

Veterans.gov is a small (for now), simple website aimed at meeting the needs of the most frequent interactions a veteran has with the VA. It is not complete, exhaustive or definitive. But it is a start in a new direction — a very public experiment in how the agency can communicate going forward.

We're building this with a small team. A few great content strategists / problem solvers, a Presidential Innovation Fellow, and a [designer (me)](http://dannychapman.com). Here's a look at how we're meeting these principles from a design perspective.

### Be quiet

There are no images, and [taking a page from gov.uk](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/06/18/retiring-our-icons/), there aren't even any icons to distract you. Text, color, and a simple grid provide structure and hierarchy. Whenever possible, content is presented in one column. This way, there's less change of getting lost, distracted, or confused about what's truly important. Simply read top to bottom, then make your next decision.

### Be respectful

There are no tricks, nothing to pull your attention from the content that is most important. No sidebar, no widgets. No pop-ups or surveys. Nothing to take your attention away. Content is presented with a simple typeface designed for the screen.

### Be empathic

We understand that veterans.gov content will be used and reused in many different contexts. It will be viewed on computers old and new. On dialup connections, slow wireless networks and broadband. Building with web standards, and a mobile-first, responsive approach helps us plan for this. We're building simple web pages that can easily be printed, displayed in an RSS reader, a Twitter Card, a TV screen, or a news aggregator with the best of results.

### Build something empowering and easy to use.

Usability testing has been baked into our design process, and will continue to be with every iteration. Nothing tops testing veterans.gov with actual veterans. Our plan is to continue to do usability testing as we build, and as we have analytics, combine our testing results with data to make the user experience better.


### We need your help.

As a designer leading the charge on this project, it's been an amazing privilege to work on such a big challenge filled with great purpose. But we can't do it alone, nor should we.

If you're a designer, copywriter, user experience designer or usability expert, we need your help to make this better. Join us on GitHub and help us provide a level of service to  veterans that we can all be proud of. Got a content edit for us? Found a design problem that needs fixing? We need to hear from you.
