One of the primary challenges for any government website is that while the internet may have started in academic and government labs it is now in many ways an overwhelmingly commercially driven environment. And the tools, the language, and the ideas that make sense in a commercial space do not necessarily make sense in a government space. Even in cases when the government is providing services—cases like VA—the service is not a consumer service, and so it doesn't necessarily call for a consumer experience, even if it may draw from the knowledge that makes good consumer experiences possible. The challenge is trying to understand which ideas make sense and which ones don't.

One idea that the veterans.gov team has talked about in this context is about bounce rates. For those readers who aren't familiar with the term, bounce rate ["...represents the percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave ('bounce') rather than continuing on to view other pages within the same site."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_rate) For a commercial sites a high bounce rate is usually considered a bad thing. Commercial sites—like brick and mortar retail stores—are designed to keep users on the sites as long as possible in order to sell a product, to deliver a marketing message, to collect usage data, and so on.

But what about government sites? Most people don't want their government to sell to them, or market to them, or to invade their privacy. So keeping the user of a government site around doesn't make the same kind of sense that it does on a commercial site. What if instead a government site could be designed such that a user—a citizen, possibly looking to receive government benefits to which they are entitled—could transact their business in one page? Imagine the brick and mortar equivalent: what if, when it was time to renew your driver's license, you could go to your local department of motor vehicles, walk directly to an open counter, fill out the form or forms that you needed to fill out, and walk away to go about your day, all in the span of five or ten minutes? Who wouldn't want that? But to get there you probably wouldn't look at retail store design for answers. In fact you might look at what retail stores do and design an experience that is in many ways the opposite of a commercial experience. And it's the same idea with bounce rate and veterans.gov: if we could, we would love to make a site where visitors got exactly what they needed in one page and then bounced off the site.

On the veterans.gov team, one of the things we have been working with to try and achieve this is to break up content into smaller and smaller discrete bits. First, this enables better discovery through search, which is how users today will typically find content (as opposed to navigating through a portal, for example). Second, this enables the user to make better decisions about whether or not they are in the place that makes sense for them to do what they came to do. In both of these cases, even if we don't achieve the goal of the user leaving after one page, we will hopefully enable to move trough the site faster to get to the action or the information that they are looking for.
