### It can be hard for me to visit VA facilities. Are there services I can access online?

Yes. You may be able to use these different virtual options:

- **The Veteran Training online self-help portal for overcoming everyday challenges:** You can use this portal's tools to work on problem-solving skills, manage anger, develop parenting skills, and more. The tools are based on proven mental health practices that have successfully helped other Veterans and families. The portal is free and anonymous. You don't have to sign in or provide any personal information to use any of these tools.<br>
[Visit the Veteran Training portal](www.veterantraining.va.gov).

- **Smartphone Apps for Veterans:** We've partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) to create free smartphone applications you can use to help manage your physical and mental health. These include apps to help you deal with stress, quit smoking, and more.<br>
[Learn more about apps for Veterans](http://ncgwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Resources_-Apps-for-Veterans.pdf).

- **The VA Telemental Health program:** Our telemental health program offers virtual mental health services by connecting you with a mental health provider through a computer or mobile device in your home or at a local VA health facility. If you're enrolled in VA health care, ask any of your providers to help connect you with telemental health programs.

### Will using mental health services at VA put my career at risk?

A mental health diagnosis or seeking mental health care doesn't automatically put work-related credentials such as security clearances at risk. Most employers recognize that healthy employees who get help if they need it are more productive and effective in their jobs than those who aren't performing at their best because they're not feeling well.

### Are there VA mental health resources for friends, family members, and Caregivers of Veterans?

Yes. In addition to online resources, Caregiver Support Coordinators at your neartest VA medical center and a Caregiver Peer Support Mentoring Program help connect Caregivers to one another for support and learning.

 Call Caregiver Support Line 855-260-3274, Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., EST
 Find a local Caregiver Support Coordinator at caregiver.va.gov/help_landing.asp

You can also contact Coaching Into Care to speak directly with a licensed psychologist or social worker, free-of-charge, who can provide information on mental health, VA services, and tips on how to begin the conversation about treatment with a loved one.
 Call 1-888-823-7458, Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., EST
 Visit https://www.mirecc.va.gov/coaching/

### How do I get mental health services through VA?

The VA health care program covers mental health services. To get these services, first apply for VA health care. 


<br>

<span id="no-benefits"></span>
### What if I don’t have VA health benefits?

You may still be able to get care:

- **If you’ve served in a combat zone,** get free private counseling, alcohol and drug assessment, and other support at one of our 300 community Vet Centers. [Find a Vet Center near you](/facilities/).
- **If you’re homeless or at risk of becoming homeless:**
  - Visit our website to learn about VA programs for Veterans who are homeless. [Learn about our homelessness programs](https://www.va.gov/homeless/).
  - Contact the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans at 1-877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+18774243838">1-877-424-3838</a>) for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A trained VA counselor will offer information about VA homeless programs, health care, and other services in your area. The call is free and confidential.
  - Call or visit your local VA Community  Resource and Referral Center. Even if you don’t qualify for VA health care, our staff can help you find non-VA resources you may qualify for in your community. [Find your local Community Resource and Referral Center]( https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/Crrc.asp).

**Please note:** If you don’t qualify for VA health care, you may still be able to get certain health care services (like care for issues linked to military sexual trauma). Call our general VA hotline at <a href="tel:+1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (<abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>) to find out what your care options may be.
