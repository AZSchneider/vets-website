### It can be hard for me to visit VA facilities. Are there services I can access online?

Yes. You may be able to use these different virtual options:

- **The Veteran Training online self-help portal for overcoming everyday challenges:** You can use this portal's tools to work on problem-solving skills, manage anger, develop parenting skills, and more. The tools are based on proven mental health practices that have successfully helped other Veterans and families. The portal is free and anonymous. You don't have to sign in or provide any personal information to use any of these tools.<br>
[Visit the Veteran Training portal](www.veterantraining.va.gov).

- **Smartphone Apps for Veterans:** We've partnered with the Department of Defense (DoD) to create free smartphone applications you can use to help manage your physical and mental health. These include apps to help you deal with stress, quit smoking, and more.<br>
[Learn more about apps for Veterans](http://ncgwg.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Resources_-Apps-for-Veterans.pdf).

- **The VA Telemental Health program:** Our telemental health program offers virtual mental health services by connecting you with a mental health provider through a computer or mobile device in your home or at a local VA health facility. If you're enrolled in VA health care, ask any of your providers to help connect you with telemental health programs.

### Will using mental health services at VA put my career at risk?

A mental health diagnosis or seeking mental health care doesn't automatically put work-related credentials such as security clearances at risk. Most employers recognize that healthy employees who get help if they need it are more productive and effective in their jobs than those who aren't performing at their best because they're not feeling well.

### Can I speak to a fellow Veteran who's been through this before?

Yes. **BeThere** is a Peer Assistance Line and outreach center available for all Veterans and Servicemembers (including National Guard and Reserves) and their families. You can talk privately with peer coaches who are Veterans, Servicemembers, and spouses. 

**To talk with a peer coach:**

- [Start an online chat](https://www.betherepeersupport.org/)
- Call 1-844-357-PEER (<a href="tel:+18443577337">1-844-357-7337</a>)
- Text to <a href="tel:+14803606188">1-480-360-6188</a>

### What other options do I have?

#### If you're a combat Veteran

You can visit one of our Vet Centers to get free individual and group counseling for you and your family. You can access these services even if you're not enrolled in VA health care and aren't receiving disability compensation.

**Vet Centers offer services such as:**
- Military sexual trauma (MST) counseling
- Readjustment counseling
- Bereavement (grief) counseling
- Employment counseling
- Substance abuse assessment and referral

[Find a Vet Center](/facilities)

Or call 1-877-WAR VETS (877-927-8387) to speak to a fellow Combat Veteran about your experiences, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.

#### If you'd like to connect with other Veterans, families, and local services 

You can visit our Make the Connection website. This site connects millions of Veterans, and their family members and friends, to local VA and community mental health resources. Visit the site to access these referral resources, and hear Veteran testimonials of strength and recovery.
