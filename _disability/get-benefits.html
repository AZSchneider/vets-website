      <h3>What should I expect?</h3>

      <h4>Who is this for?</h4>
      <p>This information is for Veterans who are submitting claims for disability compensation. Servicemembers who are getting ready to seperate, and dependents and survivors of Veterans and Servicemembers may also submit claims for compenstation. Learn more about these claims here. (link to "Learn" article tbd)</p>

      <h4>How long will it take to submit a claim?</h4>
      <p>The current average (<a href="http://http://www.app.hospitalcompare.va.gov/index.cfm">data through March 2015,</a>) for the length of time to complete a claim for disability compensation once it has been submitted to the <abbr>VA</abbr> is 201.5 days (about 29 weeks or a little over six months).</p>


      <h4>What are the steps in completing a claim?</h4>

      <ol class="checklist">
        <li>
          <span class="meta who">(you)</span>
          <h5>Prepare</h5>
          <p>Before you submit a claim you will need to spend some time assembling information that supports your claim (read "What do I need to do to prepare to submit a claim?" below to get started)</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="meta who">(you)</span>
          <h5>Submit</h5>
          <p>There are a few methods for submitting a claim:</p>
          <ul class="small-block-grid-4">
            <li><span>Online</span></li>
            <li><span>By mail</span></li>
            <li><span>By phone</span></li>
            <li><span>In person</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>and there are two types of claims:</p>
          <ul class="small-block-grid-2">
            <li><span>Fully Developed Claim (<abbr>FDC</abbr>)</span></li>
            <li><span>Standard Claim</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>The <abbr>VA</abbr> currently recommends submitting a Fully Developed Claim online (url) online. This process is usually the fastest way to get a decision on your application. [is this true or are we just saying this?]</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="meta who">(you and <abbr>VA</abbr>)</span>
          <h5>Review </h5>
          <p>Once the <abbr>VA</abbr> receives your application, a Veterans Service Representative at the VA is assigned to review your claim. While reviewing your claim, the Veterans Service Representative may decide that more information is needed to make a decision.</p>

          <p>The Veterans Service Representative may contact you and ask for more information and/or may work with you [who does the exam scheduling?] to schedule a medical examination for you at a <a href="http://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/evidence.asp">VA facility or a cooperating health care provider facility</a>. If you are scheduled for an exam this will be a special exam only to review your disability claim and not for a general check-up or for other health conditions that you may have at the time of the exam. [reference?] The Veterans Service Representative may also reach out to other government agencies, such as the Department of Defense, to request more information. [reference?]</p>

          <p>The Veterans Service Representative who reviews your claim may go through more than one round of Reviewing and Clarifying the information that supports your claim. Every claim is different because every Veteran is different. Some claims may require no additional information to make a decision, and some claims may require multiple rounds to make a decision.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="meta who">(<abbr>VA</abbr>)</span>
          <h5>Decide</h5>
          <p>When the Veterans Service Representative reviewing your claim has assembled enough information they will make a decision on your claim and send it to you by mail.</p>

          <h4>Do I need anything while I'm waiting?</h4>
          <p>Unless the VA writes to you and asks for additional information there is nothing you need to do. The VA will send you a letter if further information is needed. <a href="https://iris.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/928/related/1/session/L2F2LzEvdGltZS8xNDMwOTI0NjEzL3NpZC9BTmxpS0ZsbQ%3D%3D">This letter will outline the evidence needed to support your claim.</a></p>
