<p>C-123 Aircraft were used to spray Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. However, after being contaminated with chemical residue, they continued to fly throughout the world, and did so through 1986. If you flew on or worked with these planes in Vietnam, or other locations, you may have been exposed.</p>
