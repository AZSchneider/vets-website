      <h3>Standard Claims</h3>

      <p>Original: As a standard claim, <abbr title="Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> is responsible for getting relevant records from any Federal agency that you adequately identify and authorize <abbr title="Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> to obtain.</p>

      <abbr title="Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> will make every reasonable effort to obtain relevant records not held by a Federal agency that you adequately identify and authorize <abbr title="Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> to obtain. These may include privately held evidence and information you tell us about (such as records from a private doctor or hospital) and/or records from State or local governments or current or former employers.

      <abbr title="Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> will provide a medical examination for you, or get a medical opinion, if determined it is necessary to make a claims decision.
    -->
