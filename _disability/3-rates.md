The amount of compensation depends upon the severity of your disability.  VA determines this based on the evidence you send us, as well as the information VA obtains from your military records.  VA rates disability from 0% to 100% in 10% increments (for example, 10%, 20%, 30%).  See the [Combined Ratings page](http://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/rates-index.asp#combined) for information about how VA calculates disability percentage for multiple disabilities.
