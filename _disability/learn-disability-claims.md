# Learn about disability claims

### What are the different kinds of disability claims?

##### VA processes several kinds of disability claims that depend on when you submit the claim and for what particular kind of disability. Only Veterans can file for disability compensation [Is this true?]. Dependents and survivors can, however, file for other VA benefits and services.

##### 1. Original disability claim 
An original claim is the first claim filed for disability compensation with VA.
VA encourages you to submit an original claim soon after your discharge from the military to ensure that all relevant documents are easily available.

##### 2. New disability claim

A new disability claim is for a service-connected disability that has never been filed with VA.

##### 3. Reopened disability claim

A reopened disability claim is a resubmission of a previously denied claim filed with VA and over one year old.

##### 4. Secondary disability claim
A secondary disability claim is a new claim linked to an existing VA-recognized service-connected disability.
