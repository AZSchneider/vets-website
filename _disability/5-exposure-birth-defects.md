Spina bifida is a birth defect in which the developing baby's spinal cord fails to develop properly. It can be caused by environmental factors. If you have spina bifida or certain other birth defects and are the biological child of a Veteran with qualifying service in the Republic of South Vietnam or the Republic of Korea, you may be eligible for VA benefits.
