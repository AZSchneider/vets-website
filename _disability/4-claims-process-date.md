When VA determines it will pay a compensation award based on a claim, it assigns an effective date. The effective date determines when benefits are payable to you. This varies based on the type of benefit you’re applying for and the circumstances of your claim.

### How Effective Dates Are Assigned
Below are explanations of how effective dates are determined in various cases:

### Direct Service Connection
The effective date for a disability that resulted from or was aggravated by military service is either: 
-	The date VA receives a claim, or 
-	The date entitlement arose—whichever is later. 

“The date entitlement arose” means the date a doctor noted in your medical records that the condition existed. (This is also called “by medical evidence.”) 

If you file a claim within one year of separation from active service, the effective date will be the day following separation.  

#### Example 1 
A Veteran separated from active service on September 30, 2013, and filed a claim for several hearing disabilities. VA received the claim on November 15, 2014. On March 10, 2015, VA determined the Veteran had a 30% disability rating with a date of entitlement of November 15, 2014—the date VA received the claim.

#### Example 2 
A Veteran separated from active service on September 30, 2013, and filed a claim for several hearing disabilities. VA received the claim on July 5, 2014. Because the claim was received within one year of separation from active service, VA awarded the Veteran a 30% disability rating with a date of entitlement of October 1, 2013—the day after the Veteran’s separation.

### Presumptive Service Connection
If VA receives your claim for a disability presumed to be related to military service within one year of separation from active service, then the effective date is the date entitlement arose (when it was noted by a doctor in your medical records). 

If VA receives a claim after one year has passed since separation from active duty, the effective date is when VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

#### Example 1
A Veteran who separated from active service on September 30, 2013, underwent medical tests on April 15, 2014, that revealed high blood pressure (hypertension). She filed a claim that VA received on July 1, 2014. Because VA received the claim less than one year after the Veteran separated from active service, the effective date is set as April 15, 2014—the date entitlement arose.  

#### Example 2
A Veteran who separated from active service on September 30, 2013, underwent medical tests on April 15, 2014, that revealed high blood pressure (hypertension). She filed a claim that VA received on October 2, 2014. Because VA received the claim more than one year after the Veteran separated from active service, the effective date becomes October 2, 2014—the date the claim was received. 

### Reopened Claims
The effective date for a reopened claim is the date VA received the claim or the date entitlement arose, whichever is later.

### Liberalizing Law Change
If there is a change in law or VA regulation that allows VA to pay disability compensation, the effective date may be assigned in the following ways:
-	If VA decides to review a claim within one year from the effective date of the law or VA regulation, or VA receives the claimant’s request within one year from the date of the new law or regulation, the effective date may be the date the law or regulation changed.
-	If more than one year has passed since the law or regulation changed, an effective date of either one year before VA’s own review or one year before the claimant’s request for review may be assigned as the effective date.

### Dependency and Indemnity Compensation
For claims based on death in service, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the death actually or was presumed to have occurred. 

If the death occurred after service and VA received the claim within one year of the Veteran’s death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died.

If the death occurred after service and VA received the claim more than one year after the Veteran’s death, the effective date is the date VA received the claim.

### Error
If VA finds an error in a previous decision, the effective date of the new decision will be the date from which benefits would have been payable had there not been an error.

### Difference of Opinion
A decision that is based on a difference of opinion will have an effective date of the original decision, had it been favorable.

### Increases
Increases in the disability rating are dated back to the earliest date when it can be shown that there was an increase in disability, but only if the new claim request is received within one year from such date. Otherwise, the effective date is the date the claim was received.

### Disability or Death Due to Hospitalization 
If VA receives the claim within one year after the date the Veteran suffered the injury or aggravation, the effective date is the date the injury occurred or the aggravation began. 

If VA receives the claim more than one year after the Veteran suffered the injury or aggravation, the effective date is the date VA receives the claim. 

In the case of death, if VA receives a claim within one year from the date of the Veteran’s death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died. 

If VA receives the claim more than one year after the Veteran’s death, the effective date is the date VA receives the claim.
