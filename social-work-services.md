### What will happen when I meet with a VA social worker?</button>

Your social worker will ask questions about the Veteran or Servicemember's:
- Health
- Living situation
- Family and other support systems
- Military experience

They'll also ask what you think your family needs help with.

Then, they'll write up an asssessment that will help you, the Veteran or Servicemember, and their VA health care team make plans to get them the treatment and support they need.

### What if we don't agree with the social worker's assessment?

That's okay. Your social worker is here to help you and your family. If you don't agree with their assessment, talk with your VA health care team about your concerns so you can work together to find a plan that works for you.

### How will a VA social worker support my family if the Veteran or Servicemember is in the hospital?

Your VA social worker will help to make sure the Veteran or Servicemember gets consistent care from the time they're admitted to the hospital through to any ongoing follow-up treatment or support they may need when you're discharged. This includes planning and providing any needed services based on the Veteran or Servicemember's health and family and living situation as well as available government and community resources.
  
### Can a VA social worker help my family to find a free place to stay if the Veteran or Servicemember is being treated in a hospital far from home?

Yes. Your social worker will connect you to a nonprofit organization called the Fisher House Foundation. This Foundation offers comfortable homes where military and Veteran families can stay free of charge while their loved one is in the hospital. In these homes, families stay in a private suite with private bedrooms and baths and share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, and dining and living rooms. You can find Fisher House Foundation homes at military and VA medical centers around the world.<br>
[Find a Fisher House near where your Veteran or Servicemember will be treated](https://www.fisherhouse.org/programs/houses/house-locations/).<br>

The Fisher House Foundation also runs a program that uses donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of wounded, injured, and ill Servicemembers and a program that uses donated hotel points to allow family members to stay at hotels near medical centers for free.<br>
