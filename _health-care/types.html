      <h3>Dental Care</h3>

      <p>VA offers comprehensive dental care benefits to certain qualifying Veterans.

      <p>Services offered through VADIP include diagnostic, preventive, surgical, emergency, and endodontic and restorative treatment. Veterans and other beneficiaries who choose to purchase VADIP pay a fixed monthly premium and any copayments required for coverage, depending on the type of plan selected.</p>
