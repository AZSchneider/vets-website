      <h3>Vet Centers</h3>

       <p>Vet Centers provide community-based counseling, outreach, and referral services to eligible Veterans who served in any combat zone and their families. Services include counseling for transitioning and readjustment, military sexual trauma, and issues related to marriage, family, and bereavement. Referrals to VA mental health care, employment, education, and other services and benefits are also provided.</p>

       <p>More than 300 Vet Centers are located throughout the United States. Veterans living in rural areas may also access these services through Mobile Vet Centers (MVCs), which travel from county to county to reach as many Veteran as possible.</p>
