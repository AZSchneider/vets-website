The Principles of Excellence program requires participating educational institutions to:

- Provide a personalized form to help you understand the total cost of your educational program, including costs covered by your benefits, financial aid you may qualify for, your estimated student-loan debt upon graduation, and other information to help you compare aid packages offered by different schools
- Provide an educational plan with a completion timeline that shows how and when you can fulfill the requirements for graduation
- Designate a point of contact to provide you with ongoing academic and financial advice (including access to disability counseling) 
- Accommodate both long and short absences due to service obligations for active duty and Reservists
- Ensure accreditation of all new programs before enrolling students
- Align their refund policies with those under Title IV, which governs the administration of federal student financial aid programs
- End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentations

Foreign schools, high schools, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, residency and internship programs, and institutions that do not charge tuition and fees are not required to comply with the Principles of Excellence.
