If your tuition is more than what's covered by the Tuition Assistance (TA) program, you may be eligible for additional assistance. Tuition Assistance Top-Up covers the difference between the full cost of a college course and the amount covered under active-duty TA for up to 36 months.

### Are you eligible for compensation?

**Yes, if:**

- You are approved for federal TA
- You are eligible for Montgomery GI Bill® Active Duty or Post-9/11 GI Bill® benefits
- The tuition and fees for your desired course total more than TA will cover

#### Who is covered

- You

#### Available benefits
- Additional tuition funding  

#### How it works

If you are using the Montgomery GI Bill®, you will receive the difference between the DOD payment and the total cost of the course. If you get assistance through the Post-9/11 GI Bill®, your school will be reimbursed the difference between the DOD payment and the authorized maximum tuition and fees.

***NOTE:*** VA encourages you to consult with your education officer and the GI Bill® Comparison Tool before applying for this benefit because your use of Top-Up will affect your GI Bill® payments. If you intend to take additional courses after leaving the military, you should calculate whether your remaining GI Bill® benefits will cover your needs.
- If you use the Montgomery GI Bill®, this benefit will be reduced by, or charged, one month of entitlement for each payment received that is equal to the full-time monthly [GI Bill® rate](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/resources/benefits_resources/rate_tables.asp).
- If you use the Post-9/11 GI Bill®, this benefit will be charged based on training time, not your reimbursement amount. Half-time training rates reduce your GI Bill® benefit by a half-month for each month you are enrolled.


***NOTE:*** In no case will the combined amount paid by DOD and VA exceed the total cost of the course.
