If you are seeking education or training opportunities and have served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. This program is a major overhaul of the Montgomery GI Bill. 

### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if:
•	You meet the basic requirements for any GI Bill program
•	You have served on active duty for at least 90 days, whether continuous or interrupted, after September 10, 2001
•	You make an irrevocable election of the Post-9/11 GI Bill (and forgo use of any other GI Bill)

Making an “irrevocable election” means that you cannot change back to another GI Bill program for which you may also be eligible after you receive Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

### Who is covered
You and/or your dependents

### Available benefits
- Significant tuition-funding assistance 
- A location-adjusted housing allowance out of which you can pay your living expenses during enrollment

### How it works
The benefit amount varies according to where you use the benefit and the amount of your active-duty service since September 10, 2001. 

#### The program:
- Covers the entire in-state tuition for state schools and up to the national maximum ($21,084.89) for private or foreign schools. Learn more
- Pays you the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) of an E-5 with dependents based on the cost of living for the specific location of your school.

**Example:** If you were attending University of California, Los Angeles, in 2015, you would receive a BAH of up to $2,433 a month while in school. If you were attending the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, you would receive up to $1,638 while in school. 

- Provides up to 36 months of educational benefits, generally payable for 15 years following your release from active duty
- Uses a percentage-of-maximum-benefit scale based on how much active service you have had since September 10, 2001  

**Example:** If you have had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. Three years of active service qualifies you for 100% of the benefit. 

#### Also includes: 
- The Yellow Ribbon Program, which provides additional support to cover higher private-school and out-of-state tuition and fees.
- The Transfer of Entitlement Option, which enables eligible Service Members to transfer all 36 months or a portion of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to a spouse or children.
