If you are a full-time or three-quarter-time college, vocational, or professional student using VA education benefits, you may be eligible for this VA internship program. 

### Are you eligible for benefits?
Yes, if:
You are using one of the following VA education benefits:  
- Post-9/11 GI Bill ([Veterans](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_gibill.asp) and [transfer-of-entitlement recipients](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/post911_transfer.asp))
- Montgomery GI Bill ([active duty](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/mgib_ad.asp) and [Selected Reserve](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/mgib_sr.asp))
- [Reserve Educational Assistance Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/reap.asp)
- [Veterans' Educational Assistance Program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/veap.asp) 
- Dependents’ Educational Assistance Program (Note: Eligible dependents under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 35 may use work study only while enrolled at an educational institution in one of the 50 states.)
- [National Call to Service](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/national_call_to_service.asp) 
- [Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment program](http://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/index.asp) 
And if:
- You can complete the work-study contract before the end of your eligibility for education benefits
- You are enrolled at least three-quarter time at an institution of higher learning
- There is a position available within your normal commuting distance

### Who is eligible?
You and your dependents using education benefits

### Available benefits
Paid internships

### How it works
The number of applicants selected depends on the availability of VA-related work at your school or at VA facilities in your area. Veterans with service-connected disabilities of at least 30% may be given priority consideration.

You can [download a copy](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-22-8691-ARE.pdf) of the application form or get help with your application from the [Regional Processing Office](http://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/regional_processing.asp) that handles your claim. Your school’s financial aid office can provide other sources of assistance as well.

Services you perform under a VA work-study program must be VA related, such as working at:

- A VA facility
- Department of Defense, Coast Guard, or National Guard facilities relating to the administration of the Montgomery GI Bill—Selected Reserve or the Reserve Educational Assistance Program
- A state Veterans agency to help Veterans obtain vocation rehabilitation and employment benefits
- A Center of Excellence for Veteran Student Success to support and coordinate the academic, financial, physical, and social needs of Veteran students
- A cooperative program run jointly by VA and an institution of higher learning
- An institution of higher learning in any veterans-related position, such as assisting Veteran students with general inquiries about Veteran benefits, processing necessary documents, or maintaining and organizing veteran-related files


***How much will I earn?***

You’ll earn an hourly wage equal to the federal minimum wage or your state minimum wage, whichever is greater. If you’re in a work-study job at a college or university, your school may pay you the difference between the amount VA pays and the amount the school normally pays other work-study students doing the same job.

You may elect to be paid in advance for 40% of the number of hours in your work-study agreement, or for 50 hours, whichever is fewer. After you’ve completed the hours covered by your first payment, VA will pay you each time you complete 50 hours of service, or bi-weekly, whichever comes first.

You may work during or between enrollment periods. The total number of hours you work during your enrollment can’t be more than 25 times the number of weeks in your enrollment period.
