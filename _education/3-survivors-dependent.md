If you are a dependent or survivor of a Veteran, you may be eligible for education assistance through a GI Bill program.

### Are you eligible for benefits?

Yes, if:
- You are a child or spouse of a Service Member who died in the line of duty after September 10, 2001, or
- You are a dependent of a Veteran who is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related condition, or
- You are a survivor of a Veteran who died while on active duty or as a result of a service-related condition, or
- You are eligible to receive a transfer of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits

### Who is covered
You

### Available benefits
- Education and training opportunities
- Significant tuition-funding assistance
- A location-adjusted housing allowance for paying your living expenses during enrollment
- A stipend for books and supplies

### How it works
There are two main GI Bill programs offering education assistance to survivors and dependents of Veterans:

- [The Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (Fry Scholarship)](Link to beta site) is available for children and spouses of Service Members who died in the line of duty after September 10, 2001. 
- [The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) program](Link to beta site) offers education and training opportunities to eligible dependents of Veterans who are permanently and totally disabled due to a service-related condition or who died while on active duty or as a result of a service-related condition.

You may be eligible for both of these programs, but can only use one of them. Youâ€™ll have to decide which one when you apply, and once you make this decision, it is final.

**Exception:** As a beneficiary, you cannot use the same qualifying event for more than one benefit unless you are a child of a Service Member who died in the line of duty before August 1, 2011.
