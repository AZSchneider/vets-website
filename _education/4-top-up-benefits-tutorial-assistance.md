If you are currently using VA educational assistance, and there’s a specific deficiency you need to address, you may be eligible for a financial supplement to pay for a tutor. 
</div>
<div class="small-12 columns" markdown="1">
<div class="call-out">### Are you eligible for benefits?

**Yes, if:**

- You are using VA educational assistance
- You are pursuing an educational program at half-time or more
- You are presently enrolled in the course in which you are deficient
- The course is a required part of your educational program

#### Who is covered

-You

#### Available benefits

-A supplement to the regular education benefit


#### How it works 
The monthly rate of this supplement may not exceed $100, and the total payable may not be greater than $1,200. Your course instructor must identify the need for a tutor and write a letter on your behalf for your VA student file. If approved, the school assigns a tutor to you and confirms the hourly rate. You, your selected tutor, and your school’s certifying official must complete and sign [VA Form 22-1990t](http://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-22-1990t-are.pdf), Application for Individualized Tutorial Assistance. If you are using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your professor must also sign section 18 of this form.

This application must be submitted at the end of each month during which you require tutoring. Each monthly application must be signed and dated on or after the date of the last certified tutoring session (Form 22-1900t, item 12b).

There is no entitlement charge for the first $600 of your [Montgomery GI Bill](beta link) or for your [Post-9/11 GI Bill](beta link) or [Dependents’ Educational Assistance](beta link).

*Exception:* Tutorial Assistance is not available for Reservists using the Reserve Educational Assistance Program benefit.
