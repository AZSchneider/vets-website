        Identifying the date of the incident within a 60-day window helps us
        better research your claim. Some other ways to place the date range are
        to recall what the weather was like when the event happened – warm or
        cold – to identify the season, or to identify whether it was early or
        later in your deployment or perhaps think of a landmark or place you
        were during a particular time.
