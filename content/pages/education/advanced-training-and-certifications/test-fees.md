We’ll charge your GI Bill benefit package for the cost of the test. The amount will be deducted from your total GI Bill funds.

For tests taken before August 1, 2018, if you got paid back for testing under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, we charged a whole month of entitlement pay. For tests taken after this date, we'll charge your benefits just for the actual amount of the testing fee.
