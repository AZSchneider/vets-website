When you can use your benefits depends on your relationship to the Veteran or Servicemember:

#### Spouses
- May use the benefit right away
- May use the benefit while the Servicemember is on active duty or after separation
- Don’t qualify for the monthly housing allowance while the Servicemember is on active duty
- May use the benefit for up to 15 years after the Servicemember's separation from active duty

#### Children
- May start to use the benefit only after the Servicemember has finished at least 10 years of service
- May use the benefit while the Servicemember is on active duty or after separation
- May not use the benefit until they’ve gotten a high school diploma (or equivalency certificate), or have reached 18 years of age
- Qualify for the monthly housing allowance even when the Servicemember is on active duty
- Don’t have to use the benefit within 15 years after the Servicemember's separation from active duty, but can’t use the benefit after they’ve turned 26 years old.

You may still qualify for benefits even if you're a dependent child who gets married or a dependent spouse who gets divorced. However, Servicemembers and Veterans can revoke (withdraw) or change a Transfer of Entitlement (TOE) at any time.
