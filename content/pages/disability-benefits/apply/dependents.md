<div class="va-introtext">

Find out how to add a dependent spouse, child, or parent to your VA disability compensation benefits so you can get a higher payment to help support your family.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Can I add a dependent to my VA disability compensation benefits?

You may be able to add a dependent spouse, child, or parent to your benefits if you meet the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. You:**	

- Are receiving VA disability compensation, **and**
- Have a 30% or higher disability rating <br>

Adding a dependent may make you eligible to receive a higher compensation payment (also called a benefit rate).

<br>

### Who can I add as a dependent?

**You can add your:**

- Spouse (we recognize same-sex and common-law marriages)
- Unmarried child (including a biological, adopted, or stepchild) who: 
  - Is under 18 years old, **or**
  - Is between the ages of 18 and 23 years old and enrolled in school full time, **or**
  - Became seriously disabled before they turned 18 
- Parent, if you’re directly caring for them and their income and net worth are below a certain amount

</div>

### When should I add a dependent to my benefits?

This depends on where you are in the process of applying for disability benefits.

#### If you haven’t yet applied for disability benefits

You can apply to add your dependent at the same time you file your disability claim.

If you receive a 30% or higher disability rating, we’ll automatically consider your dependent when we determine your disability compensation.

[Find out how to apply for disability benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/). 


#### If you have one or more dependents, but didn’t add them when you filed your original disability claim

If you’ve received a 30% or higher disability rating, you can apply online to add your dependent now.

#### If something changes in your family status after you’ve started receiving compensation

You can apply online to add any new dependents right away. This could affect your dependent’s eligibility for benefits.

**You can add a dependent if:**

- You get married 
- You have or adopt a child
- Your child who is between 18 and 23 years old and enrolled in school full time
- Your child becomes severely disabled before turning 18
- You become the caregiver for a parent whose income and net worth is below a certain amount

<br>

#### To add a dependent child or spouse

You can apply online. You may also need to provide more information or forms along with your application.

**If you’re claiming a seriously disabled child,** you’ll need to turn in all private medical records for the child’s disabilities with your application. 

**If your dependent is a child who’s between 18 and 23 years old and attending school full time,** you’ll need to also submit a Request for Approval of School Attendance (VA Form 21-674) with your application. <br>

Yes, but we encourage you to apply online. The online application is simple, and you can upload any needed supporting documents along with your application. 

When you file your claim online, you can also save the day you start your claim as the effective benefit start date. This means that if we decide you’re eligible for a higher compensation rate, we’ll pay you back to this date.

<div id="questions-apply-paid-back" class="usa-accordion-content">

We may pay you back to the date of your marriage or the birth or adoption of your child if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**
	
- Had already received your 30% or higher disability rating at the time of the marriage, birth, or adoption, **and**
- Applied to add the dependent within a year of the marriage, birth, or adoption, **and**
- Responded within a year to our request for any more information needed to confirm your dependent <br>

If it’s been more than a year since you got married or had or adopted a child, we may not pay you back to the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption. Instead, we may pay you back only to the date you applied to add the dependent or, in some cases, up to a year before you applied.

*Note: Will need to confirm if this is changing with the form being added to Vets.gov.*

You can check this through your eBenefits account.

Sign in to your account and click the “Dependents” link under the “My Profile” section. 

If you see your dependents listed there, you should be receiving compensation for them. If they’re not listed, you can apply to add them. <br>

### Questions about adding or removing specific dependents	

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-Veteran-spouse">What if my spouse is also a Veteran with a 30% or higher disability rating? Can we claim each other and our children? Or should only one of us add them as dependents?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-Veteran-spouse" class="usa-accordion-content">

If you and your spouse are both Veterans with a 30% or higher disability rating, you can both claim each other and your children.

**You should know:** It’ll take us longer to process your application if you’re claiming a dependent spouse who’s also a Veteran. But if you apply online, and we decide you’re eligible for higher compensation, we’ll pay you back to the date you started your application.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-divorce-remove">What happens if I get divorced or need to remove a dependent?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-divorce-remove" class="usa-accordion-content">
	
*Note: Will need to confirm if this is changing with the form being added to Vets.gov*

You can remove a dependent online through eBenefits. We’ll need more time to process a claim to remove a dependent child than a dependent spouse, but the online process is still much faster than submitting a paper claim.

**If you get divorced and need to remove your former spouse or a dependent stepchild of your former spouse**, you’ll want to submit the claim right away. You don’t have to submit or upload the supporting paperwork into eBenefits. 

This will help to make sure you don’t keep receiving compensation for these dependents after the divorce. If you don’t tell us to remove these dependents and keep receiving extra compensation for them until we discover the error, we may withhold money from your future compensation payments until you’ve paid it back. <br>

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-child-school">How will VA know not to remove my child from my benefits if they turn 18 but are still in school? Do I have to reapply?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-child-school" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
*Note: Will need to confirm if this is changing with the form being added to Vets.gov.*

You’ll need to update your child’s school information in eBenefits. 

Sign in to your eBenefits account. Click “Add or Remove Dependents” under the “Apply” section on the homepage. 

Then select “Update Dependents.” <br>

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-specific-child-old">Do I have to remove my child from my compensation benefits once they’re too old to be claimed as a dependent?</button>
<div id="questions-specific-child-old" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. We’ll track your child’s age based on the date of birth you give us when you apply to add them as a dependent. When your child turns 18, we’ll remove them from your disability compensation unless you update their information and let us know they’re enrolled in school full time.
