You can use the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program to get a faster decision on your disability benefits claim. With this program, you send in all the evidence or supporting documents you have—or can easily get—when you file your claim.

If we discover that there are other private records we need to decide your claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and review it through the standard claims process. Find out how you can participate in the FDC program.

#### FDC Program

When turning in your claim under the FDC program, please send us all the supporting documents you have and provide information about supporting documents that you don’t have.

1. [Fill out an Application for Disability Compensation (VA Form 21P-526EZ)](/disability-benefits/apply/).<br>
2. When you file your claim, you'll need to turn in:
    - A copy of your DD214 or other separation documents,  **and**
    - Service treatment records,  **and**
    - All private and VA medical records related to your illness or injury, **and**
    - Information about any health records that are available at a federal facility, like a VA medical center or clinic
3. Go to any VA medical appointments required to decide your claim.

#### Standard Claim Process

With a standard claim, you’ll give us permission to gather evidence or records for you. You’ll need to give us enough information about the evidence so we can request it from the right person or agency.

If a person or agency refuses to turn over the evidence, asks for money for the evidence, or can’t get the evidence, we’ll ask you to try to get the evidence or records. It’s your responsibility to make sure we receive all requested records that aren’t at a federal agency or office.
