### Can I file my disability compensation claim through the Decision Ready Claim Program?

Right now, you may be able to file a DRC if you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Are filing a Pre-discharge Claim (a claim for disability compensation filed by Servicemembers who have less than 90 days remaining before separation from military service), **or**), **or**
- Are filing a Dependency and Indemnity Compensaion (DIC) Claim (for surviving spouses of Veterans who died due to a service-related injury or disease and was rated 100% disabled due to service-connected conditions, including entitlement to Individual Unemployability, for 10 years before they died), **or** 
- Have already filed a VA claim and received a rating decision from us on that claim, and you're now filing one of these types of claims:
  - **Direct Service Connection Claims** for conditions that began during your military service or were caused by an event while serving
  - **Presumptive Service Connection Claims** for conditions that are presumed to have been caused by an event during your military service, even if there's no specific evidence showing a connection between your condition and your military service in your records. This includes conditions related to Agent Orange, chronic disailibilities, and conditions tied to service during the Gulf War (like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and functional gastrointestinal disorders)
  - **Secondary Service Connection Claims** for conditions that were caused or made worse by a service-connected disability
  - **Increased Disability Claims** for existing service-connected conditions that you have medical evidence to show have gotten worse

**Note:** You'll need to also check the exclusions below to see if your claim may be disqualified from the DRC Program.

### How do I file a Decision Ready Claim?

You'll need to follow the steps below. When you work with an accredited VSO and provide all the necessary evidence with your application, you can get a decision on your claim in 30 days or less.

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one">Appoint and work with an accredited VSO</li>
  Accredited VSOs are fully trained on the DRC Program. They can help you determine if a DRC is right for you. 
  
  <li class="process-step list-two">Gather all relevant and required evidence to support your claim</li>
  This includes your federal and medical records as well as any needed Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs). Your VSO will help you gather everything you need.
  <li class="process-step list-three">Attend a VA claim exam, if needed</li>
  If it's needed, your VSO can request a claim exam for you. You'll then work with a VA partner to quickly schedule an exam at a time that works best for you. The results of your exam can then be included along with your application.
  <li class="process-step list-three">Submit your claim</li>
  Your VSO will check to make sure all of the necessary information is included and help you electronically submit your claim to VA. Giving VA all the relevant evidence when you submit your DRC allows your claim to go directly to a VA Rating Specialist for a decision.
  
</ol>
