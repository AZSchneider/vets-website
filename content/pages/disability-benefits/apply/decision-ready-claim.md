<h3 itemprop="name">Can I file my disability compensation claim through the DRC program?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Right now, you may be able to file a DRC if you meet the requirements listed below.

**You must be filing one of these types of claims:**
- **A pre-discharge claim** for disability compensation less than 90 days before your separation from military service, **or**
- **A dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) claim** as the surviving spouse of a Veteran who died due to a service-related injury or disease and had a 100% disabled rating due to a service-connected condition, including entitlement to Individual Unemployability, for 10 years before they died

**Or, all of these must be true:**
- You've already filed a VA claim, **and**
- You've received a rating decision from us on that claim, **and**
- You're now filing one of these claims:**
  - **A direct service connection claim** for a condition that began during your military service or was caused by an event while serving
  - **A presumptive service connection claim** for a condition that we believe is related to your military service even if there's no direct evidence of a link. This includes conditions related to Agent Orange, chronic disailibilities, and conditions tied to service during the Gulf War (like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and functional gastrointestinal disorders).
  - **A secondary service connection claim** for a condition caused or made worse by your service-connected disability
  - **An increased disability claim** for an existing service-connected condition that you have medical evidence to show has gotten worse

**And, you can't have any of the exclusions listed in the blue box below.**

### How do I file a DRC?

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one"><strong>Appoint and work with an accredited VSO</strong><br>

    </li>  
  <li class="process-step list-two"><strong>Gather all relevant and required evidence to support your claim</strong><br>
    This includes your federal and medical records as well as any needed Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs). Your VSO will help you gather everything you need.
    </li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Attend a VA claim exam, if needed</strong><br>
    Your VSO can request a claim exam for you. You'll then work with a VA partner to quickly schedule an exam at a time that works best for you. The results of your exam can then be included along with your application.
    </li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Submit your claim</strong><br>
    Your VSO will check to make sure your application includes all of the needed information and help you electronically submit your claim. Giving us all the relevant evidence when you submit your DRC allows us to send your claim directly to a VA Rating Specialist for a decision.
