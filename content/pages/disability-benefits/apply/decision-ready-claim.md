### How do I file a DRC?

You'll need to follow the steps below. When you work with an accredited VSO and provide all the necessary evidence with your application, you can get a decision on your claim in 30 days or less.

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one"><strong>Appoint and work with an accredited VSO</strong><br>
    Accredited VSOs are fully trained on the DRC Program. They can help you determine if a DRC is right for you.<br>
    [Go to eBenefits to search for a VSO near you](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/vso-search).
    </li>  
  <li class="process-step list-two"><strong>Gather all relevant and required evidence to support your claim</strong><br>
    This includes your federal and medical records as well as any needed Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs). Your VSO will help you gather everything you need.
    </li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Attend a VA claim exam, if needed</strong><br>
    Your VSO can request a VA claim exam for you. This exam is also sometimes called a compensation & pension (C&P) exam. You'll then work with a VA partner to quickly schedule an exam at a time that works best for you. The results of your exam can then be included along with your application.
    </li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Submit your claim</strong><br>
    Your VSO will check to make sure your application includes all of the needed information and help you electronically submit your claim. Giving us all the relevant evidence when you submit your DRC allows us to send your claim directly to a VA Rating Specialist for a decision.
    </li>
