Find out when you can first file a claim for service-connected benefits—and what to do if you want to reopen a denied claim or request more benefits.

### Can I file a claim while I'm on active duty?

Yes. You can file a claim up to 180 days before leaving the service. We refer to this first claim as your original claim.

You can file a disability claim while you're still on active duty if you:

- **Had a disability before entering the military that got worse because of your service** (called a preservice claim), **or**

- **Have a disability that was caused by an illness or injury you got while on active duty** (called an inservice claim)

**Please note:** If you get disability benefits for a preservice claim, the amount of compensation (monthly payments) you’ll get will be based on the level of aggravation, or how much worse your service made your disability. For example, if you had an illness or injury (also known as a condition) that was 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to service, then the level of aggravation would be 10%.

You should also know:

- **If you have 90-180 days left on active duty**, you may be able to file a predischarge claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. [Find out how to file a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim).

- **If you have less than 90 days left on active duty**, you can't file your claim through the BDD program. But you can still file prior to discharge, and your claim will be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim.</br>

### Can I file a claim after I leave the military?

Yes. There's no time limit on filing a disability claim. But the process may become more complex the longer you wait.

You can file a claim after separation if you:
- **Had a disability before entering the military that got worse because of your service** (called a preservice claim), **or**
- **Have a disability that was caused by an illness or injury you got while on active duty** (called an inservice claim), **or**
- **Have a disability related to your active duty service that doesn't appear until after you've left the military**.This is called a postservice claim. You may qualify for benefits for these postservice disabilities:</br>
  - [Disabilities that appear within 1 year after discharge](/disability-benefits/apply/one-year/)</br>
  - [Disabilities believed to be caused by contact with hazardous materials](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/)</br>
  - [Disabilities related to service in Southwest Asia (Gulf War Service)](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/gulf-war-illness/)</br>
  - [Disabilities related to time spent as a Prisoner of War (POW)](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/pow/)
<br>

### What if I have special needs linked to my service-connected disability?

You can file a special claim to request compensation for special needs. These can include needs such as:
- A specially equipped vehicle if your service-connected disability prevents you from driving, **or**
- Temporary payments if you're recovering from surgery or other treatment and unable to move, **or**
- Increased payments if you can't work because of your service-connected disability

[Learn more about special claims](/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/).

<br>

### What should I do if my disability claim was denied, but I have new evidence to support my claim?

You can file a reopened claim if all of these are true:
    - We denied your claim at least 1 or more years ago, **and**
    - You didn’t file an appeal at that time, **and**
    - You have new and material evidence (new supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results) that we haven’t seen before and that’s directly related to your claim

For example, you might file a reopened claim if you were treated for pain in your elbow while on active duty, but were denied disability benefits because the VA health exam didn't find a problem, and then two year's later you get an X-ray of your elbow that shows signs of arthritis (a painful swelling and sometimes wearing down of a joint). In this case, you would need to send your new exam and X-results to us as new evidence related to the claim.

<br>

### What should I do if I'm already getting disability benefits, but think I should get more?

You can file a new claim to request:
    - More financial support
    - Special monthly payments
    - A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability). [Learn more about Individual Unemployability](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).

<br>

### What should i do if I develop a new (secondary) disability that's linked to a service-connected disability I already have?

You can file a secondary claim to get more disability benefits for the secondary disability. 

For example, you might file a secondary claim if you:
- Develop arthritis that's caused by a service-connected knee injury you got while on active duty, **or**
- Develop heart disease that's caused by caused by the high blood pressure you were diagnosed with while on active duty and that we'd previously concluded was connected to your service
