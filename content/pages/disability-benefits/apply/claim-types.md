Find out which type of disability claim to file based on your active duty status and the nature and timing of your disability.

### What type of claim should I file if I'm still on active duty?

If you have a disability and you're 90 to 180 days from separation from active-duty service, file a **predischarge claim** unless your case requires special handling. [Learn how to file a predischarge claim](TBD).

### What type of claim should I file if I had a disability before entering the military, but it was made worse because of my service?

File a **preservice** claim. (/disability/apply/)

If you get disability benefits for a preservice claim, the amount of compensation (monthly payments) you’ll get will be based on the level of aggravation, or how much worse your service made your disability. For example, if you had an illness or injury (also known as a condition) that was 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to service, then the level of aggravation would be 10%.

### What type of claim should I file if my disability was caused by an illness or injury that I got while on active duty?

[File an **inservice claim**].(/disability/apply/)

### What type of claim should I file if my disability is related to my service, but didn't appear until after I left the military?

File a **postservice claim**.

You may qualify for benefits for these postservice disabilities:

[Disabilities that appear within 1 year after discharge](/disability-benefits/apply/one-year/)
[Disabilities believed to be caused by contact with hazardous materials](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/)
[Disabilities related to service in Southwest Asia (Gulf War Service)](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/gulf-war-illness/)
[Disabilities related to time spent as a Prisoner of War (POW)](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/pow/)

### What type of claim should I file if my disability is related to a special circumstance?

WILL FILL IN AFTER MEETINGS.

### Other claim type terms you should know

As you go through the disability claims process, it'll be helpful to know how we talk about claims. These are some of the terms we use to identity different stages of claims:

- **Original claim:** The first claim you file for a disability when you're within 180 days of separation.

- **Reopened claim:** A claim you can file to request a new decision on a disability claim we denied in the past if all of these are true:
  - We denied your claim at least 1 or more years ago, **and**
  - You didn’t file an appeal at that time, **and**
  - You have new and material evidence (new supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results) that we haven’t seen before and that’s directly related to your claim

For example, you might file this type of claim if you were treated for pain in your elbow while on active duty, but were denied disability benefits because the VA health exam didn't find a problem, and then two year's later you get an X-ray of your elbow that shows signs of arthritis (a painful swelling and sometimes wearing down of a joint). In this case, you would need to send your new exam and X-results to us as new evidence related to the claim.

- **New claim:** A claimed you can file when you're already getting disability benefits, but you think you should get more. When you file a new claim, you may get:
  - More financial support
  - Special monthly payments
  - A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability). [Learn more about Individual Unemployability](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).

- **Secondary claim:** A claim you can file for a second disability caused—or made worse—by a service-connected disability you already have (like newly developed arthritis caused by a service-connected knee injury you got while on active duty or newly diagnosed heart disease caused by your high blood pressure that we had earlier concluded was caused by your service).
