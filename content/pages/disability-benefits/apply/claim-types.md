<spand id="claim-active">

### Can I file a claim while I'm on active duty?

Yes. You can file a claim up to 180 days before leaving the service. We refer to this first claim as your original claim.

- **If you have 90-180 days left on active duty**, you may be able to file a predischarge claim through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. [Find out how to file a predischarge claim](/disability-benefits/apply/claim-types/predischarge-claim).

- **If you have less than 90 days left on active duty**, you can't file your claim through the BDD program. But you can still file prior to discharge, and your claim will be processed after separation as a fully developed or standard claim. [Learn more about the evidence needed for fully developed and standard claims](/disability-benefits/apply/evidence/).

### Can I file a claim after I leave the military?

Yes. There's no time limit on filing a disability claim. But you should know that the process may become more complex the longer you wait.

### What if I have special needs linked to my service-connected disability?

You can file a special claim to request compensation for special needs. These can include needs such as:
- A specially equipped vehicle if your service-connected disability prevents you from driving, **or**
- Temporary payments if you're recovering from surgery or other treatment and unable to move, **or**
- Increased payments if you can't work because of your service-connected disability

<br>

<spand id="claim-reopened">

### What if my disability claim was denied, but I have new evidence to support my claim?

You can file a reopened claim if all of these are true:
- We denied your claim at least 1 or more years ago, **and**
- You didn’t file an appeal at that time, **and**
- You have new and material evidence (new supporting documents like a doctor’s report or medical test results) that we haven’t seen before and that’s directly related to your claim

For example, you might file a reopened claim if you were treated for pain in your elbow while on active duty, but were denied disability benefits because your VA health exam didn't find a problem, and then 2 year's later you get an X-ray of your elbow that shows signs of arthritis (a painful swelling and sometimes wearing down of a joint). In this case, you would need to send your new exam and X-results to us as new evidence related to the claim.

<spand id="claim-new">

### What if I'm already getting disability benefits, but think I should get more?

You can file a new claim to request:
- More financial support
- Special monthly payments
- A shift to Individual Unemployability status (a status given to Veterans who are unable to work because of a disability). [Learn more about Individual Unemployability](https://www.vets.gov/disability-benefits/conditions/special-claims/individual-unemployability/).

<br>

<spand id="claim-secondary">

### What if I develop a new (secondary) disability that's linked to a service-connected disability I already have?

You can file a secondary claim to get more disability benefits for the secondary disability. 

For example, you might file a secondary claim if you:
- Develop arthritis that's caused by a service-connected knee injury you got while on active duty, **or**
- Develop heart disease that's caused by caused by the high blood pressure you were diagnosed with while on active duty and that we'd previously concluded was connected to your service
