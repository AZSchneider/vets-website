### Can I get disability benefits from VA?

You may be able to get disability benefits if both of the below descriptions are true for you.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange, **and**
- You came into contact with Agent Orange while serving in the military

[See the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).


#### Who’s covered?

- Veterans
- Qualified dependents

</div>

### What kind of disability benefits can I get?

- Health care
- Compensation (payments)

### How do I get these benefits?

You’ll need to apply for benefits. 

**If you have an illness believed to be caused by Agent Orange,** you won’t need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. This is because we believe that certain diseases are the result of exposure to herbicides (called "presumptive diseases"). <br>
[See the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).

When you file your claim, you'll need to submit this evidence:
- A medical record that shows you have an Agent Orange‒related illness, **and**
- A military record that shows your service dates in Vietnam or in or near the Korean demilitarized zone, **and**
- A document that proves exposure to herbicides in a location other than Vietnam or the Korean demilitarized zone

[Apply for disability benefits](/disability-benefits/apply/).

**If you have an illness that’s not on the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses,** but you believe it was caused by Agent Orange, you’ll need to show the problem started during—or got worse because of—your military service. <br>
[See the list of Agent Orange‒related illnesses](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/agent-orange/diseases/).

When you file your claim, you'll need to submit this evidence:
- A medical record showing your current disability, **and**
- A medical record showing a connection between exposure to Agent Orange and the current disability, **and**
- A document that proves either:
   - Contact with Agent Orange in a location other than Vietnam or the Korean demilitarized zone, **or**
   - Service in Vietnam or at or near the Korean demilitarized zone during the dates listed below
