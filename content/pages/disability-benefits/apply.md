For all disability claims you'll have a chance to provide evidence to support your claim. Evidence could include:  

- VA medical records and hospital records that relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries
- Private medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries
- Supporting or lay statements from family, friends, or coworkers with knowledge of your claimed illness or injuries 

**Please note:** You don’t have to submit evidence or supporting documents for your disability claim. If you don't submit any evidence, we may schedule a claim exam for you to help us decide your claim. You have up to 1 year from the date we receive your claim to turn in any evidence.
