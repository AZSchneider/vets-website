To show your intent to file, please:

- Fill out and mail an Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC (VA Form 21-0966).  [Download VA Form 21-0966](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0966-ARE.pdf), **or**
- Submit an intent to file at a regional benefit office near you. [Find a regional benefit office](/facilities/), **or**
- Work with a trained professional at a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) to get help submitting an intent to file
