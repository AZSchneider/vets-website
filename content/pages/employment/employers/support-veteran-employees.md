Veterans are civic assets who can draw on their experiences to improve your business. When a Servicemember first joins a private-sector company, there may be a transition period for both the Veteran and the company. You may be wondering how you can support Veterans, Reservists, and National Guardsmen in your workplace. <br> [Find out how with this web-based tutorial](https://www.va.gov/VETSINWORKPLACE/training/EAP/default.htm).

If your company has not previously hired Veterans, learn about how you can design and implement a Veterans hiring initiative. <br> 
[Find out how you can implement a Veterans hiring initiative](http://www.dol.gov/vets/ahaw/index.htm). <br> 
- A Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E) Employment Coordinater can help if you are interested in hiring Veterans with service-connected disabilities. <br> 
[Learn more from a Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)Coordinator](https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/docs/EmploymentCoordinators.xls). <br> 
- There may also be tax credits of up to $9,600 for every eligible Veteran hired through the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which is administered by the Department of Labor. <br> [Learn more about tax credits for hiring veterans]( https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/eligible.cfm#Veterans).

In addition to the services listed above, VR&E provides employers with other benefits through the Special Employer Incentives (SEI) program. An employer hiring a Veteran with a service-connected disability who is approved for VR&E services may be entitled to reimbursements of up to 50% of the Veteranâ€™s salary for 6 months to offset training costs. <br> [Read about the VR&E program](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/index.asp), or <br> 
Call <a href="tel:+1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (<abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>).

Employers participating in an on-the-job training (OJT) program can hire a Veteran at the apprenticeship wage and VA will supplement that wage with GI Bill payments. The training often results in permanent, full-time employment and provides employers with a well-trained Veteran employee.

Apprenticeship programs allow a Veteran to enter into a training contract for a specific period of time with an employer or union, and then at the end of the training period, the Veteran gains job certification or journeyman status. <br> [Find out more about apprenticeship programs](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/).

Federal, state, or local government offices can set up a Non-paid Work Experience (NPWE) program to provide Veterans with internship opportunities. A VR&E Employment Coordinator can assist you if you are interested in setting up a NPWE program. <br>

### Learn more about how to support your Veteran employees with disabilities:

- Some Veterans may have disabilities that were acquired or aggravated during their military service; these are called service-related or service-connected disabilies. <br> [Learn more about service-connected disabilities](/disability-benefits/conditions/).
- Protections for Veterans with service-connected disabilities differ under USERRA and the ADA. This guide describes how the ADA, in particular, applies to recruiting, hiring, and accommodating Veterans with service-connected disabilities. <br> [Understanding Your Employment Rights Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): A Guide for Veterans](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/ada_veterans.cfm).
