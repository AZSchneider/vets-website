<div class="va-introtext">
A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many restaurants, hotels, stores, and other businesses. With this card, you won’t need to carry around your military discharge papers or share sensitive personal information to receive these discounts. Find out if you’re eligible for a Veteran ID Card—and how to apply.
</div>

#### Am I eligible for a Veteran ID Card?
**You may be eligible for a Veteran ID Card if both of these are true. You:**
- Served on active duty, in the military reserves, or in the National Guard (including the Coast Guard), **and**
- Received an honorable or general discharge
</br>
If you’ve received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable character of discharge, you’re not eligible for a Veteran ID Card. If you have an uncharacterized or unknown discharge status, we’ll have to verify your eligibility before we approve your application.</br>
You’ll need to provide a copy of your discharge papers when you apply for a VIC to prove your character of discharge.
</br>

</br>
#### What do I need to apply for a Veteran ID Card? 
When you apply, be sure to have these on hand:
* Your Social Security number
* A digital copy of your DD214, DD256, DD257, or NGB22 that you can upload. This could be a .pdf or other photo file format, like a .jpeg or .png
* A copy of a current and valid government-issued ID, such as a driver’s license, passport, or state-issued identification card.     
* A digital color photo of yourself from the shoulders up.</br>
<br>
 **The photo should follow all the standards listed here. It must:**
 * Show a full front view of your face and neck (with no hat, head covering, or headphones covering or casting shadows on your hairline or face), **and**
 * Be cropped from your shoulders up (much like a passport photo), **and**
 * Show you with your eyes open and a neutral expression, **and**
 * Be taken in clothing you’d wear for a driver’s license photo, **and**
 * Be a square size and have a white or plain-color background (with no scenery or other people in the photo), **and**
 * Show what you look like now (a photo taken sometime in the last 10 years), **and**
 * Be uploaded as a .jpeg, .png, .bmp, or .tiff file
  <br>
#### What happens after I apply for a Veteran ID Card?
Once you’ve successfully submitted your VIC application, we’ll check your eligibility and verify that:
- Your character of discharge meets eligibility requirements, **and**
- The ID you submitted (driver’s license or passport) is valid, **and**
- The image you’ve chosen to appear on the card meets the photo requirements

After we’ve verified your eligibility, we’ll send you an email letting you know the status of your application. If you have an unknown or uncharacterized discharge status, your application will take more time to process while we verify your eligibility. (We may need to request your records from the National Personnel Records Center.)
If you receive email from us that we need additional information or evidence to process your application, you’ll need to sign in to AccessVA and update your application with the additional information. 
<br>
#### How can I check the status of my application?
You can sign in to your Vets.gov or AccessVA account to check the status of your VIC application.</br> 
[Sign in to your Vets.gov account](/vets.gov/).</br>
[Sign in to your AccessVA account](https://preprod.access.va.gov/accessva/?cspSelectFor=vic).</br>

<div id="cards-used-instead" class="usa-accordion-content">

**You can use any of these forms of ID to get the same discounts:**

- A Department of Defense (DoD) Identification Card—either a Common Access Card (CAC) or Uniformed Services ID Card, **or**
- A Veterans designation on a state-issued driver’s license or ID
<br>
If you already have one of these, you don’t need a Veteran ID Card, but you can still apply for it if you’d like.
