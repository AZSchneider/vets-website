As the family member of a Servicemember or Veteran, you may qualify for certain benefits like health care, VA-backed home loans, life insurance, or help paying for college. If you’re caring for a disabled Veteran, you may also qualify for support designed to help you better care for the Veteran—and for yourself. Find out what benefits you may qualify for—and how to access them.

### Health Care Benefits
If you’re the spouse, surviving spouse, dependent child, or family caregiver of a Servicemember or Veteran, you may qualify for health care benefits through VA or through the Department of Defense. In certain cases, you may also qualify for health care benefits due to a disability related to your Veteran’s service.
