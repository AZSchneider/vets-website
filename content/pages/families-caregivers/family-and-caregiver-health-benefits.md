### TRICARE

If you’re the family member of an active-duty, retired, or deceased Servicemember, National Guard member, Reservist, or Medal of Honor recipient, you may qualify for the TRICARE program.

TRICARE is the health care program for uniformed Servicemembers and their families around the world. It provides comprehensive coverage, including health plans, prescription medicines, dental plans, and programs for people with special needs. The Department of Defense’s Defense Health Agency manages this program. [Find out if you qualify for TRICARE—and how to apply](https://www.tricare.mil/).

### The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)

If you’re the current or surviving spouse or child of a disabled or deceased Veteran—and you don’t qualify for TRICARE—you may be able to get health insurance through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). Through this program, we share the cost of certain of your health care services and supplies. [Find out if you qualify for CHAMPVA— and how to apply](/healthcare/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/).

### The Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers of Post-9/11 Veterans

If you’re a family member who’s caring for a disabled Veteran who was injured in the line of duty on or after September 11, 2001, you may qualify for health care benefits and other caregiver support through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance to Family Caregivers.

### The Camp Lejeune Family Member Program
Did you live—along with an active-duty Veteran who was your spouse or parent—at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune or Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) in North Carolina for at least 30 cumulative days from August 1953 through December 1987? You may have had contact with contaminants in the drinking water there. Scientific and medical evidence has shown an association between exposure to these contaminants and developments of certain diseases later on.
If you now have one of the related conditions, you may qualify for health care benefits through VA. [Find out if you qualify for this program—and how to apply](/disability-benefits/conditions/exposure-to-hazardous-materials/contaminated-drinking-water-at-camp-lejeune/#familymembers).
