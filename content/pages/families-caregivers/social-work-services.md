### How can a VA social worker help Veteran or Servicemember I'm caring for?

Our social workers can help Veterans and Servicemembers with many different needs.

**VA social workers can help if the Veteran or Servicemember you're caring for is:**

- **In a crisis situation.** We can counsel the Veteran or Servicemember through the crisis, and then help connect them to VA and community resources to meet their long-term needs.
- **Homeless, often in the hospital, or unable to care for themselves any longer.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember find housing, including in an assisted living or nursing home if needed.
- **In the hospital.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember make plans for their ongoing care at home or in a rehab or other facility. 
- **Living in a rural location far from a VA health facility.** We can work with the Veteran or Servicemember's health care team to make sure they get the care they need from VA or in their community.
- **Having trouble speaking up for themselves or feeling overwhelmed by trying to arrange care.** We can serve as the Veteran or Servicembmer's voice to make sure get what they need.
- **Struggling with depression, sadness, stress, anxiety, PTSD, drinking or drug use.** We can offer counseling and work with the Veteran or Servicemember and their health care team to create a treatment plan.
- **Dealing with end-of-life issues.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember make decisions about life support, organ donation, and other issues and communicate these decisions to their health care team.

- Family and other support systems
- Military experience

They'll also ask what you and the Veteran or Servicemember think you need help with.

Then, they'll write up an asssessment that will help you and the Veteran or Servicemember's VA health care team make plans to get them the treatment and support they need.

<span id="disagree">

### What if we don't agree with the social worker's assessment?

That's okay. Your social worker is here to help you and your family. If you don't agree with their assessment, talk with your VA health care team about your concerns so you can work together to find a plan that works for you.

### Can a VA social worker help my family to find a free place to stay if the Veteran or Servicemember in our family is being treated in a hospital far from home?

Yes. Your social worker will connect you to a nonprofit organization called the Fisher House Foundation. This Foundation offers comfortable homes where military and Veteran families can stay free of charge while their loved one is in the hospital. In these homes, families stay in a private suite with private bedrooms and baths and share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, and dining and living rooms. You can find Fisher House Foundation homes at military and VA medical centers around the world.<br>
[Find a Fisher House near where your Veteran or Servicemember will be treated](https://www.fisherhouse.org/programs/houses/house-locations/).<br>

The Fisher House Foundation also runs a program that uses donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of wounded, injured, and ill Servicemembers and a program that uses donated hotel points to allow family members to stay at hotels near medical centers for free.<br>
[Learn more about all Fisher House Foundation programs](https://www.fisherhouse.org/).

Your social worker can also help you find out if the Veteran or Servicemember is eligible for help with travel expenses if they need to travel for care.<br>
