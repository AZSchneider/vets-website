### How do I know if I should talk with a VA social worker?

You may want to talk to a social worker if you're dealing with family problems like:

- Struggling in your marriage
- Feeling overwhelmed with child care
- Caring for a parent or spouse who's ill
- Losing someone close to you
- Feeling that someone is taking advantage of or mistreating you in a relationship

You may want to talk to a social worker if you need help with things like:

- Applying for VA, Social Security, or other government or community benefits
- Getting financial assistance
- Making sure you'll get the care you need when you're discharged from the hospital
- Finding housing if you're homeless
- Moving to an assisted living facility, a board and care home, or a nursing home
- Getting support and services to help you be able to live as independently as possible in your own home
- Making end-of-life decisions like whether you want to be on life support equipment or be an organ donor, and which family member or other person you'd like to make decisions on your behalf when you're unable to make those decisions for yourself

You may also want to reach out to a social worker if you're struggling with:

- Stress because of your health or because your health problems make it hard to live your life the way you want to
- Feelings of being sad, depressed, or anxious
- Drinking or drug use
- Speaking up for yourself or feeling overwhelmed by trying to arrange your care
- Helping your family to understand your health problems and how to help support you
- Just feeling like something isn't right

These are just some examples. You can talk with a VA social worker about any questions or problems you may have. We'll help you or connect you with the right person to help.

### Can a social worker help if I'm in a crisis situation?

Yes. Your social worker can help to counsel you through the crisis. Then, they can help you apply for programs and services through VA and in your community to meet your long-term needs.

### What if I don't know know what I need, but just think I need help?

That's 100% okay. We're here to help you figure out what's wrong, and how we can help.

### Can a social worker help my family too?

Yes. Your social worker can offer help like:

- Family counseling to help you and your family with any relationship struggles
- Arranging for respite care in your home so your family caregiver can run errands, go on vacation, or just take a break
- Educating you and your family about your health problems, how to live a more healthy life, how to deal with stress, and how to access the programs and services you need
- Helping your family find a free place to stay close by if you need to receive treatment in a hospital far from home

### How do I request an appointment with my local social worker?

**If you're receiving care through VA**, you can ask your health care team to set up an appointment with a social worker for you.

**If you're not enrolled in the VA health care program, or if you haven't yet received care through VA**, you can call your nearest VA health facility and ask to be connected to a social worker.<br>
[Find contact information for your local VA health care facility](/facilities).

### What will happen when I meet with my social worker?

Your social worker will meet with you, and with your family if you’d like.

They’ll ask you questions about:
- Your health
- Your living situation
- Your family and other support systems
- Your military experience
- What you feel you need help with

Then, they'll write up an asssessment that will help you, your family and other support people, and your VA health care team make plans to get you the treatment and support you need.

### What if I don't agree with the social worker's assessment?

That's okay. Your social worker is here to help you and those caring for you. If you don't agree with their assessment, talk to your family, other support people, and VA health care team about your concerns so you can work together to find a plan that works for you.
**THIS IS A MADE-UP ANSWER BUT WE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HELP DISPELL FEARS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE THERE TO TAKE THINGS AWAY.**

### How will my social worker work with me if I'm in the hospital or soon to go into the hospital for treatment?

Your social worker will help to make sure you get consistent care from the time you're admitted to the hospital through to any ongoing follow-up treatment or support you may need when you're discharged. This includes coordinating your discharge planning and planning and providing any needed services based on your health, family and living situation, and government and community resources.
