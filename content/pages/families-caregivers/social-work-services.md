### How can a VA social worker help the Veteran or Servicemember I'm caring for?

Our social workers can help Veterans and Servicemembers with many different needs.

**VA social workers can help if the Veteran or Servicemember you're caring for is:**

- **In a crisis situation.** We can counsel the Veteran or Servicemember through the crisis, and then help connect them to VA and community resources to meet their long-term needs.
- **Homeless, often in the hospital, or unable to care for themselves any longer.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember find housing, including in an assisted living or nursing home if needed.
- **In the hospital.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember make plans for their ongoing care at home or in a rehab or other facility. 
- **Living in a rural location far from a VA health facility.** We can work with the Veteran or Servicemember's health care team to make sure they get the care they need from VA or in their community.
- **Having trouble speaking up for themselves or feeling overwhelmed by trying to arrange care.** We can serve as the Veteran or Servicembmer's voice to make sure get what they need.
- **Struggling with problems like depression, sadness, stress, anxiety, PTSD, drinking or drug use.** We can offer counseling and work with the Veteran or Servicemember and their health care team to create a treatment plan.
- **Dealing with end-of-life issues.** We can help the Veteran or Servicemember make decisions about life support, organ donation, and other issues and communicate these decisions to their health care team.

Yes. Your social worker will connect you to a nonprofit organization called the Fisher House Foundation.

In these homes, families stay in a private suite with private bedrooms and baths and share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, and dining and living rooms. You can find Fisher House Foundation homes at military and VA medical centers around the world.<br>
