Find out how our VA social workers can help you and the Veteran or Servicemember you care about—and how to connect with a social worker near you.

<span id="caregiver"></span>

<div class="feature" markdown=“1”>

### How can a VA social worker help me as the caregiver or family member of a Veteran or Servicemember?

VA social workers can help to support you with many different services.

**You can reach out to a VA social work for support if you need help:**

- **Getting family counseling.** We can help you work through any relationship struggles.
- **Understanding your loved one's condition.** We can teach you about the Veteran or Servicemember's health problems and how to help them live a more healthy life, deal with stress, and access the programs and services they need.
- **Accessing rural health care.** We can help you find medical services for the Veteran or Servicemember in the community if you live far from a VA health facility.
- **Caring for a Veteran or Servicemember who can't care for themselves.** We can help you get support to care for your loved one at home, or make arrangements for their long-term care if you can no longer provide that care yourself.
- **Supporting a Veteran or Servicemember who's struggling.** We can help you get treatment and support for your loved one if they're struggling with mental health problems, homelessness, or end-of-life issues, or just feel like something isn't right.
- **Advocating for your loved one.** We can act as your family's voice to make sure your wishes are respected and you get what you need.

These are just some examples. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to ask for an appointment with a VA social worker. We'll help you or connect you with the right person to help.

### Working with a VA social worker

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Meet-with-social-worker">What will happen when I meet with a VA social worker?</button>
<div id="Meet-with-social-worker" class="usa-accordion-content">

**Your social worker will ask questions about the Veteran or Servicemember's:**
- Health
- Living situation
- Family and other support systems
- Military experience

They'll also ask what you think your family needs help with.

Then, they'll write up an asssessment that will help you, the Veteran or Servicemember, and their VA health care team create a treatment plan.

<div id="Disagree-with-social-worker" class="usa-accordion-content">

That's okay. Your social worker is here to help you and your family. If you don't agree with their assessment, talk with the Veteran or Servicemember's VA health care team about your concerns so you can work together to find a plan that works for you.
**THIS IS A MADE-UP ANSWER BUT WE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HELP DISPELL FEARS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE THERE TO TAKE THINGS AWAY.**

<div id="Help-in-hospital" class="usa-accordion-content">

Your VA social worker will help to make sure the Veteran or Servicemember gets consistent care from the time they're admitted to the hospital through to any ongoing follow-up treatment or support they may need when they're discharged. This includes planning and providing any needed services based on their health, family and living situation, and government and community resources.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Hospital-far-from-home">Can a VA social worker help my family to find a free place to stay if the Veteran or Servicemember is being treated in a hospital far from home?</button>
<div id="Hospital-far-from-home" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. Your social worker will connect you to a nonprofit organization called the Fisher House Foundation. This Foundation offers comfortable homes where military and Veteran families can stay free of charge while their loved one is in the hospital. In these homes, families stay in a private suite with private bedrooms and baths and share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, and dining and living rooms. You can find Fisher House Foundation homes at military and VA medical centers around the world.<br>
[Find a Fisher House near where your Veteran or Servicemember will be treated](https://www.fisherhouse.org/programs/houses/house-locations/).<br>

The Fisher House Foundation also runs a program that uses donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of wounded, injured, and ill Servicemembers and a program that uses donated hotel points to allow family members to stay at hotels near medical centers for free.<br>
[Learn more about all Fisher House Foundation programs](https://www.fisherhouse.org/).

Your social worker can also help you find out if the Veteran or Servicemember is eligible for VA help with travel expenses if they need to travel for care.<br>
[Learn more about VA transportation services](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vtp/).

And, your social worker can help connect you to other community resources. These may include:
- **Angel Flight**, which provides free flights to patients in private planes. <br>
[Learn more about Angel Flight](http://www.angelflight.com).
- **Corporate Angel Network**, which uses the empty seats on private and corporate planes to offer free flights to cancer patients who need to get to a specific hospital for specialized treatment.

- **Mercy Medical Lift**, which provides long-distance medical air transport to people who don't have health insurance or can't afford transportation.
