### How can a VA social worker help me as a Veteran or Servicemember?

Our social workers can help you with many different needs.

**You can reach out to a VA social worker for support if you're:**

- **In a crisis situation.** We can counsel you through the crisis, and then help connect you to VA and community resources to meet your long-term needs.
- **Homeless, often in the hospital, or unable to care for yourself any longer.** We can help you find housing, including in an assisted living facility or nursing home if needed.
- **In the hospital.** We can help you plan for your ongoing care at home or in a rehab or other facility. 
- **Living in a rural location far from a VA health facility.** We can work with your health care team to make sure you get the care you need from VA or in your community.
- **Having trouble speaking up for yourself or feeling overwhelmed by trying to arrange your care.** We can serve as your voice to make sure your wishes are respected and you get what you need.
- **Struggling with problems like depression, sadness, stress, anxiety, PTSD, drinking or drug use.** We can offer counseling and work with you and your health care team to create a treatment plan.
- **Dealing with end-of-life issues.** We can help you make decisions about life support, organ donation, and other issues and communicate these decisions to your family and your health care team.

These are just some examples. If you have any questions or problems, feel free to ask for an appointment with a VA social worker. We'll help you or connect you with the right person to help.

### Working with a VA social worker as a Veteran or Servicemember

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Meet-with-social-worker">What will happen when I meet with a VA social worker?</button>
<div id="Meet-with-social-worker" class="usa-accordion-content">

Your social worker will ask questions about your:
- Health
- Living situation
- Family and other support systems
- Military experience

They'll also ask what you think you need help with.

Then, they'll write up an asssessment that will help you, your family or other support person, and your VA health care team make plans to get the treatment and support you need.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Disagree-with-social-worker">What if I don't agree with the social worker's assessment?</button>
<div id="Disagree-with-social-worker" class="usa-accordion-content">

That's okay. Your social worker is here to help you and your family. If you don't agree with their assessment, talk with your VA health care team about your concerns so you can work together to find a plan that works for you.
**THIS IS A MADE-UP ANSWER BUT WE MIGHT WANT SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO HELP DISPELL FEARS THAT SOCIAL WORKERS ARE THERE TO TAKE THINGS AWAY.**

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Help-in-hospital">How will a VA social worker support me if I'm in the hospital?</button>
<div id="Help-in-hospital" class="usa-accordion-content">

Your VA social worker will help to make sure you get consistent care from the time you're admitted to the hospital through to any ongoing follow-up treatment or support you may need when you're discharged. This includes planning and providing any needed services based on your health, family and living situation, and government and community resources.

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="Hospital-far-from-home">Can a VA social worker help my family to find a free place to stay if I'm being treated in a hospital far from home?</button>
<div id="Hospital-far-from-home" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. Your social worker will connect you to a nonprofit organization called the Fisher House Foundation. This Foundation offers comfortable homes where military and Veteran families can stay free of charge while their loved one is in the hospital. In these homes, families stay in a private suite with private bedrooms and baths and share a common kitchen, laundry facilities, and dining and living rooms. You can find Fisher House Foundation homes at military and VA medical centers around the world.<br>
[Find a Fisher House near where your Veteran or Servicemember will be treated](https://www.fisherhouse.org/programs/houses/house-locations/).<br>

The Fisher House Foundation also runs a program that uses donated frequent flyer miles to bring family members to the bedside of wounded, injured, and ill Servicemembers and a program that uses donated hotel points to allow family members to stay at hotels near medical centers for free.<br>
[Learn more about all Fisher House Foundation programs](https://www.fisherhouse.org/).

Your social worker can also help you find out if you're eligible for VA help with travel expenses if you need to travel for care.<br>
[Learn more about VA transportation services](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/vtp/).

And, your social worker can help connect you to other community resources. These may include:
- **Angel Flight**, which provides free flights to patients in private planes. <br>
[Learn more about Angel Flight](http://www.angelflight.com).
- **Corporate Angel Network**, which uses the empty seats on private and corporate planes to offer free flights to cancer patients who need to get to a specific hospital for specialized treatment.
[Learn more about the Corporate Angel Network](http://www.corpangelnetwork.org/home).
- **Mercy Medical Lift**, which provides long-distance medical air transport to people who don't have health insurance or can't afford transportation.
