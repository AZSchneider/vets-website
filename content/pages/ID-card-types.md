<div class="va-introtext">
There are many types of identification cards you can use to show you’re a Veteran. You only need to have one of them for this purpose, so if you already have a Veteran Health Identification Card for example, you don't need to apply for a Veteran ID Card (VIC). Learn about the different types of ID cards you can get.

</div>


### Veteran ID Card 
A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. When you have this card, you won’t need to carry around your military discharge papers or share sensitive personal information to receive discounts. If you have a VIC, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. 

#### Am I eligible for a Veteran ID Card?
You may be eligible if you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. You:**
- Served on active duty, in the Reserves, or in the National Guard (including the Coast Guard), **and**
- Received an honorable or general discharge  

If you received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable character of discharge, you’re not eligible for a Veteran ID Card. If you have an uncharacterized or unknown discharge status, we’ll have to verify your eligibility before we approve your application. 

#### How do I apply for a Veteran ID Card?
You can apply online. <br>

### Department of Defense Identification Card
A Department of Defense (DoD) Identification Card is used to show your military status and to get access to services at military bases. You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. If you have a DoD Identification Card, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. 

#### Am I eligible for a DoD Identification Card?
You’re eligible if one of the descriptions below is true for you. 

**One of these must describe you. You're:**
- Retired from the military, **or**
- On active duty, **or**
- In the National Guard, the Reserves, the Selected Reserves, or Inactive Ready Reserve

Depending on your status, the DoD issues either a Common Access Card (CAC) or a Uniformed Services ID Card (USID).

#### How do I apply for a DoD Identification Card? 
For both types of DoD cards, you'll need to either be a sponsor or have a sponsor. You’ll also need to fill out an Application for Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment (DD Form 1172-2). <br>

### Veteran’s designation on a state-issued license or ID
At this time, all 50 states and Puerto Rico offer a Veteran designation (an identifying mark) printed on state-issued driver’s licenses or IDs. The type of Veteran designation may vary from state to state.  
If you have a Veteran’s designation, you may be able to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants.

To apply for a Veteran’s designation, most states ask you to provide a copy of your discharge papers (DD214 or other separation documents). Some states may require additional documents.
