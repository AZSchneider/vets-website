### Veteran ID Card 
A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a form of photo ID you can use to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. With this card, you won’t need to carry around your military discharge papers or share sensitive personal information to receive these discounts. 
If you already have a Veteran ID Card, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. 
#### Am I eligible for a Veteran ID Card?
**You may be eligible for a Veteran ID Card if both of these are true. You:** 
- Served on active duty, in the military reserves, or in the National Guard (including the Coast Guard),  **and**
- Received an honorable or general discharge  

If you’ve received a dishonorable, other than honorable, or bad conduct character of discharge, you’re not eligible for a Veteran ID Card. If you have an uncharacterized or unknown discharge status, we’ll have to verify your eligibility before we approve your application. 
#### How do I apply for a Veteran ID Card?
You can apply online to get a Veteran ID Card.
