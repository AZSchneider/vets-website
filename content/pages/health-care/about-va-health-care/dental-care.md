### Can I get VA dental care benefits for all of my dental care needs?

**You may be eligible for any needed dental care if any one of these is true:**

- You get VA disability compensation (monthly payments) for a service-connected disability, **or**
- You're a former Prisoner of War, **or**
- You have one or more service-connected disabilities that are rated 100% disabling, **or**
- You're unable to work (called unemployable), and you get disability compensation at the 100% disabling rate due to service-connected conditions

**Note:** If you're being paid at the 100% disabling rate based on a temporary rating (for a reason such as a long stay in the hospital or rehab care), that doesn't qualify you for this benefit.

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown=“1”>

### Can I get one-time dental care when I get out of the service?

**You may be eligible for one-time dental care if you served on active duty for 90 days or longer during the Persion Gulf War era and all of these are true for you:**

- You didn't receive a dishonorable discharge when you were discharged or released from service, **and**
- You apply for dental care within 180 days of discharge or release, **and**
- Your DD214 certificate of discharge doesn't show that you had a complete dental exam and all needed dental treatment before you were discharged

**Note:** Public Law 83 enacted June 16, 1955, amended Veterans’ eligibility for outpatient dental services. As a result, any Veteran who got a dental award letter from VBA dated before 1955 in which VBA determined the dental conditions to be noncompensable is no longer eligible for Class II outpatient dental treatment.
