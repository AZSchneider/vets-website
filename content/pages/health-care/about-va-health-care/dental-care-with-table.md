### Check Your Eligibility

#### Can I get VA dental care benefits for all of my dental care needs?

You may be eligible for any needed dental care if any of the factors listed below are true for you.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Get VA disability compensation (monthly payments) for a service-connected disability, **or**
- Are a former Prisoner of War, **or**
- Have one or more service-connected disabilities that are rated 100% disabling, **or**
- Can't work because of a service-connected disability (called unemployable), and you get VA disability compensation at the 100% disabling rate

**Note:** If you're getting compensation at the 100% disabling rate based on a temporary rating for a reason such as a long stay in the hospital or rehab care, that doesn't qualify you for this benefit.

<br>

#### Can I get one-time dental care when I get out of the service?

You may be eligible for one-time dental care if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- You served on active duty for 90 days or longer during the Persian Gulf War era, **and**
- You didn't receive a dishonorable discharge, **and**
- You apply for dental care within 180 days of discharge or release, **and**
- Your DD214 certificate of discharge doesn't show that you had a complete dental exam and all needed dental treatment before you were discharged

**Note:** Public Law 83 enacted June 16, 1955, amended Veterans’ eligibility for outpatient dental services. As a result, any Veteran who got a dental award letter from VBA dated before 1955 in which VBA determined the dental conditions to be noncompensable is no longer eligible for Class II outpatient dental treatment.

#### Can I get VA dental care for specific needs?
