<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get VA health care benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may be able to get VA health care benefits if you served in the active military, naval, or air service and didn't receive a dishonorable discharge.

- **If you enlisted after September 7, 1980, or entered active duty after October 16, 1981,** you must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which you were called to active duty, unless any of the descriptions below are true for you.</br>
</br>
**This minimum duty requirement may not apply if any of these are true. You:**
  - Were discharged for a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service, **or**
  - Were discharged for a hardship or “early out,” **or**
  - Served prior to September 7, 1980

- **If you’re a current or former member of the Reserves or National Guard,** you must have been called to active duty by a federal order and completed the full period for which you were called or ordered to active duty. If you had or have active-duty status for training purposes only, you don’t qualify for VA health care.

### What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

If you've received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits.

**There are 2 ways you can try to qualify:**

<h3 itemprop="name">Is there anything that will make me more likely to get these benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Yes. You may qualify for enhanced eligibility status (meaning you’ll be placed in a higher priority group, which makes you more likely to get benefits) if you meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true. You:** 

- Receive financial compensation (payments) from VA for a service-connected disability
- Were discharged for a disability resulting from something that happened to you in the line of duty
- Were discharged for a disability that got worse in the line of duty
- Are a recently discharged Combat Veteran
- Get a VA pension
- Are a former Prisoner of War (POW)
- Have received a Purple Heart
- Get (or qualify for) Medicaid benefits
- Served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975
- Served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998
- Served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987

**If none of the above apply to you**, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes can affect whether you qualify for VA benefits. <br>

We want to make sure we can deliver full health care benefits and the highest quality care to all Veterans enrolled in the VA health care program. To help do this effectively, we enroll Veterans based on a priority system. 

When you apply for VA health care, you’ll be assigned to 1 of the 8 priority groups below, with Priority Group 1 being the highest. The higher your priority group, the faster and more likely you'll be enrolled. 

You'll be assigned based on factors like your military service history, disability rating, income level, and any other benefits you may be receiving. If you qualify for more than one priority group, we'll assign you to highest one. If you're assigned to Priority Group 7 or 8, you'll need to agree to pay copays to receive VA health care benefits.
