<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get VA health care benefits?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">


You may be able to get VA health care benefits if you served on active duty and separated under conditions other than dishonorable.

You should know:

- **If you enlisted after September 7, 1980, or entered active duty after October 16, 1981,** you must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which you were called to active duty. This minimum duty requirement may not apply if you:

  - Were discharged for a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service, **or**
  - Were discharged for a hardship or “early out,” **or**
  - Served prior to September 7, 1980

- **If you’re a current or former member of the Reserves or National Guard,** you must have been called to active duty by a federal order and completed the full period for which you were called or ordered to active duty. If you had or have active-duty status for training purposes only, you don’t qualify for VA health care.

- **If you separated under conditions other than honorable:**
  - You may be able to apply for a discharge upgrade or access some VA benefits through the Character of Discharge review process.<br/>
  [Learn more about this process](#discharge-upgrade).
  - Or, you can use VA’s Health Benefits Explorer to find out if any exceptions apply to you.<br/>
  [Go to the Health Benefits Explorer](http://hbexplorer.vacloud.us/).
  - Or, you can visit healthcare.gov to find out if you qualify for health insurance.<br/>
  [Go to healthcare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov/). <br/>
  
<br>

#### Enhanced Eligibility Status

You may qualify for enhanced eligibility status (meaning you’ll be placed in a higher priority group, which makes you more likely to get benefits) if at least one of these applies to you:

- You receive financial compensation (payments) from VA for a service-connected disability
- You were discharged for a disability resulting from something that happened to you in the line of duty
- You were discharged for a disability that got worse in the line of duty
- You’re a recently discharged Combat Veteran
- You get a VA pension
- You’re a former Prisoner of War (POW)
- You’ve received a Purple Heart
- You get (or qualify for) Medicaid benefits
- You served in Vietnam between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975
- You served in Southwest Asia during the Gulf War between August 2, 1990, and November 11, 1998
- You served at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987

If none of the above apply to you, you may still qualify for care based on your income. Learn more about how the amount of money your family makes can affect whether you qualify for VA benefits. [Learn more about income limits](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/).

We want to make sure we can deliver full health care benefits and the highest quality care to all Veterans enrolled in the VA health care program. To help do this effectively, we enroll Veterans based on a priority system. 

When you apply for VA health care, you’ll be assigned to 1 of the 8 priority groups below, with 1 being the highest priority group. The higher your priority group, the faster you'll be enrolled. You'll be assigned based on factors like your military service history, disability rating, income level, and any other benefits you may be receiving. If you qualify for more than one priority group, we'll assign you to highest one. If you're assigned to Priority Group 7 or 8, you'll need to agree to pay copays to receive VA health care benefits.

**You may be assigned to Priority Group 1 if either of these are true for you:**

- You have a service-connected disability that we've rated 50% or more disabling, **or**
- We've concluded that you can't work because of a service-connected disability (called unemployable)

<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You have 2 options to try to qualify for VA health care benefits:

- **Apply for a discharge upgrade.**<br/>
If your application goes through and your discharge is upgraded, you'll be eligible for the VA benefits you earned during your period of service.<br/>
[Find out how to apply for a discharge upgrade](/discharge-upgrade-instructions/).

- **Go through the Character of Discharge review process.**<br/>
Even if you don't get a discharge upgrade, you still may be able to access some VA health care benefits. When you apply, we'll review your record to determine if your service was “honorable for VA purposes.” This review can take up to a year. Please provide us with documents supporting your case, similar to the evidence you'd send with an application to upgrade your discharge. <br/>
<br/>
You may want to consider finding someone to advocate on your behalf, depending on the complexity of your case. A lawyer or Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can collect and submit supporting documents for you.<br/>
[Find a VSO near you](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/varo.asp).

**Note:** You can ask for a VA Character of Discharge review while at the same time applying for a discharge upgrade from the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard.

**How to get mental health care even without VA health care benefits:** <br>

If you experienced sexual assault or harassment while in the military, or need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental health problems linked to your service, you may qualify for VA health benefits even without a VA Character of Discharge review or a discharge upgrade. Call our general VA hotline at (<a href="tel:+1-800-827-1000">1-800-827-1000</a>), Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (ET) to find out what your care options may be.
