VA housing assistance can help Servicemembers, Veterans, and their surviving spouses to buy a home or refinance a loan. We also offer benefits and services to help you build, repair, or keep your current home. This includes grants for Veterans with service-connected disabilities who need to adapt their home to live as independently as possible. Find out how to apply for and manage the Veterans housing assistance benefits you've earned.</p>
