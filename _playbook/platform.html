      <h3>The Platform</h3>


        <p>The Vets.gov platform, code-named <em>The Harbor</em>, helps ensure customers and those building customer experiences have a consistent experience held to high standards, utilizing the best in design research and technology.</p>

        <h4>Services and Infrastructure</h4>

        <p>The Harbor provides central services, such as login, access to customer data, robust analytics, look/feel, design patterns, training, and toolkits. Within the Harbor, individual applications (“boats”) may dock and connect with the services they need. These apps are well-scoped and may be organized loosely into fleets for coordination purposes, e.g. “Employment Fleet” with boats for searching for jobs, posting a job-seeking profile, and translating military service into civilian skills.</p>

        <p>The Harbor is built and maintained internally within <abbr>VA</abbr> (currently helmed by the VA Digital Service). Individual boats may be constructed by internal teams, contractors, and/or other resources (e.g. <abbr>VERC</abbr>, <abbr>18F</abbr>), and will benefit from the Harbor infrastructure to deliver more and better functionality to customers, faster, without sacrificing quality, security, or privacy. A boat may be designed and sponsored by a business office, a VA administration, or in certain cases by the VE and/or DSE team.</p>

        <p>The Harbor also has strong enforcement. You cannot enter the Harbor if your boat leaks or if you are a giant Carnival Cruise ship. You must regularly scrape barnacles off your bow and keep your paint fresh. You cannot moor a bicycle. In real terms, this means apps must be 508-compliant, adhere to automated test and code review standards, and that in some cases, a legacy system will simply not be able to make the cut.</p>
